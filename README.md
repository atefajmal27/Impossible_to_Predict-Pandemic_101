## Project Objectives
#### Monte Carlo Predictions
Could doing hundreds of simulations using years of data lead us to a model that resembled what actually happened in 2020?

#### Actual Outcomes
Even doing hundreds of simulations, using data from multi-years back, the models were still flawed.
With hindsight, what would have been an excellent portfolio heading into the pandemic? This would be the ideal pandemic portfolio.
