## Project Objectives
#### Monte Carlo Predictions
Could doing thousands of simulations using years of data lead us to a model that resembled what actually happened in 2020?

#### Actual Outcomes
Even doing thousands of simulations, using data from multi-years back, the models were still flawed.
With hindsight, what would have been an excellent portfolio heading into the pandemic? This would be the ideal pandemic portfolio.

### Execution
Get 1-3 years of stock prices of different industries before COVID-19 hit the stock market (Feb 15th) using API and Google Finance. Run thousands of simulations to compare the predicted returns to the actual returns. <br/>

Find out the industries that beat the market and create an ideal portfolio.
