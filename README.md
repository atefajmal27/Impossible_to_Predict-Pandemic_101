## Project Objectives
#### Monte Carlo Predictions
Could doing thousands of simulations using years of data lead us to a model that resembled what actually happened in 2020?

#### Actual Outcomes
Even doing thousands of simulations, using data from multi-years back, the models were still flawed.
With hindsight, what would have been an excellent portfolio heading into the pandemic? This would be the ideal pandemic portfolio.

### Execution
Get 1-3 years of stock prices of different industries before COVID-19 hit the stock market (Feb 15th) using API and Google Finance. Run thousands of simulations to compare the predicted returns to the actual returns. <br/>

Find out the industries that beat the market and create an ideal portfolio.

#### Calculations

### Results
Even though most industries failed to meet the expectation, some were able to meet and beat the prediction such as technology, cryptocurrency industry etc. Here is a gif to show each portfolio's return distribution according to thousands of simulations that we ran. The red lines represents 95% confidence interval and the orange line represents the confidence level on the actual return. <br/>
