# Pandemic Strategy
Team 5’s project will help investors gain a deeper understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and offer a sound investment strategy for dealing with such an event. Examination of different, key portfolios during a national health crisis, will explore the shift in investor’s behavior, allocation strategy, risk tolerance, and provide a clear-eyed analysis of impact on small and large businesses in the U.S.

## Ground rules
1. We’ll try to stick to the timeline of Jan 2020-Present (or some subset)
2. Try to use roughly the same stocks in our analysis to tie the story together
3. Project Proposal and Outline due by the beginning of class Aug 8

## Team Assignments
1. Monetary: Bitcoin,Ethereum, Gold and Silver - *Philip*
    * How big were the fluctuations in these alternatives?
Graph?
    * Winners: “Big Four” Four +Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google
2. Shift in Investors portfolio - *Joaquim*
    * Berkshire Hathaway
    * Increase of portfolios allocation to gold and dividends stocks 
    * Emerging markets vs US high yield 
    * Stock x bonds allocations 
    * Sector weightings
3. Riskiest Investments - *Atef (check out pyfolio library)*
    * Sharpe Ratios
    * Volatility
    * Monte Carlo
4. What’s happening to small businesses? - *Kellye*
exploring small caps vs large cap index performance
    * Location (mapbox)
    * PPP distribution
    * Value stock x growth stocks
    * Grab ETFs and Indexes on the former, and compare it to the latter 
5. Wildcard: Kodak, SpaceX - *Bonus*
    * Why is this stock doing so well in a pandemic? (We’re all flying to space to GTFO)
    * Kodak: the risks or reards of investing in companies propped up during pandemic
